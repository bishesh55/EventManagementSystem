Event Management System
 I've used MaterialUI ,Tailwind and Tsx as mentioned in the task.
 Here we can simply add, edit , view and delete events.
 I have stored the added events in the localstorage.
 In conclusion I have used the following:
React 18 - Frontend framework
TypeScript - Type-safe JavaScript
Material-UI (MUI) - UI component library
Tailwind CSS - Utility-first CSS framework
React Router DOM - Client-side routing
React Hook Form - Form handling and validation
Zod - Schema validation
Local Storage - Data persistence
